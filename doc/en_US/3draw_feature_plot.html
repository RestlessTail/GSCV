	<h1>Draw feature plot</h1>
	<h2>Open GSCV archive</h2>
	<p>GSCV archives are binary files, which maintains a index of expression data so searching genes would be faster. A GSCV archive is generated by an import wizard in GSCV. To understand how to import single cell data from a Seurat object (of R language), please refer to <a href="./7import_seurat_object.html">this page</a>.</p>
	<p>Click File-Open, and select an GSCV archive (*.gscvArchive), and then the archive will be loaded. You may have noticed that a feature flot have been painted, but it is not colored yet.</p>
	<h2>Visualize gene expression data</h2>
	<p>Click Visualize-Cell color, and the cell color panel is activated. Enter the gene name in the "Search gene" box, and click "Go" to draw feature plot</p>
	<p><b>Note: </b>The program doesn't remove white characters (e.g. space, tab, etc.) in gene name, so white characters at the beginning or end of the gene name usually lead to wrong result (the most common result is that the program reports it can't find the given gene). It is recommended to check the gene name before clicking "Go", especially when pasting gene names from websites or forms.</p>
	<h2>Visualize meta data</h2>
	<p>To visualize meta data of cells (i.e. data that attached to seurat object by using function "AddMetaData" in R, such as pseudotime data), select header of meta data in the combo box "Meta", and click "Go".</p>
	<p>Once you select a new header, the list box under the combo box will show the first 20 records for preview.</p>
	<p>Note that it is required to tell the program the data is continuous variable or categorical variable (by selecting the radio button under the combo box). Different painting method is used when processing different kind of data.</p>
	<h2>Reset color</h2>
	<p>Click the "Clear" button, and the color of each cell is removed.</p>
	<h2>Close this panel</h2>
	<p>Click the "Close" button, and the panel is closed.</p>
